# Spring Security 6

Hi, this is my new Spring Security 6 microservice. I want to improve the older version that is a public repository of mine.

#### Barely done...

I will include 'Continue with google' stuff. I'll make a .env.example for those to try this out.
.env.example will include db and google credentials.

I'm going to include a tutorial to find and apply google credentials!!!
